DAY 1: Expanding Cards

In an effort to strengthen my web development knowledge (I want to do this as a living!), I've commited myself to completing to the "50 Projects in 50 Days" course by Brad Traversy. This course is provided with projects that will help sharpen my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. The end goal for this challenge is to become better at problem solving and understand more advanced CSS & JS. After finishing each project, I'll reflect on my experience.

*This first project was simple (for the most part)! To add to the fun of it, I decided to choose my own images.*

Challenges/Struggles
- forEach loops: I'm still learning JavaScript, so I'm not very familar with writing forEach loops. This was good practice!
- @media query: I wasn't sure how this worked at first
- addEventListener: haven't learned this prior to this project

What I Learned
- How to use a media query in order control which styles I want to take effect depending on the size of the screen
- How to use Flexbox (it finally clicked when I was able to watch it work as I was writing the code)
- A small taste of CSS animation (need more practice)

How might I apply this in real life?
- I could see this being used for a gallery website or portfolio.

*Well, that was Day 1. I know it will be a long and bumpy road, but I am truly excited for the journey. ✌️*
